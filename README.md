# 100 Days of Python

This repository documents a structured 100-day journey from Python beginner to confident builder. Each day focuses on learning, writing code, and applying concepts through small exercises or mini-projects.  
What started as a personal challenge has grown into a practical roadmap that anyone can follow to build a strong and reliable foundation in Python through consistent daily practice.

This repository serves two purposes:  
- A personal learning log that tracks real progress over time  
- A ready-to-use guide for learners who want to improve their Python skills step by step

## Repository structure

All content lives inside the **100 Days of Python** folder.  
Each day has its own dedicated file or subfolder containing the topic, notes (where useful), and code implementations.

Typical structure:

100 Days of Python/
├── Day 01 - <topic>/
├── Day 02 - <topic>/
├── ...
└── Day 100 - <topic>/


You can follow the journey sequentially from Day 1, or jump directly to any topic you want to revise or explore.

## What this journey covers

Across these 100 days, you will find hands-on work with:

### Core Python fundamentals  
Variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, modules, exceptions, file handling, and standard library utilities.

### Data structures and problem solving  
Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, comprehensions, string manipulation, and logic-building exercises designed to improve thinking, not just syntax.

### Object-oriented programming  
Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and building small reusable components.

### Working with files and modules  
Reading and writing files, organizing code into modules and packages, and reusing logic across multiple programs.

### Scripts and mini-projects  
Small CLI tools, automation scripts, and programs that combine multiple concepts to simulate real-world use cases.

### Progressive difficulty  
Early days focus on clarity and fundamentals. Later days emphasize combining concepts and solving more realistic problems.

(Topics may evolve over time as the repository grows and improves.)

## Learning goals

This 100-day challenge is designed to build:

- **Consistency**  
  Writing code every day, even in small amounts, to form a sustainable habit.

- **Depth of understanding**  
  Focusing on why things work, not just how to write them.

- **Portfolio-ready progress**  
  A visible, day-by-day record of growth that can be shared with recruiters, peers, or collaborators.

- **A strong base for future paths**  
  After completing this journey, moving into web development, automation, data science, or machine learning becomes much easier.

## How to use this repository

You can treat this repository as:

- **A roadmap**  
  Follow each day in order and learn alongside the progression.

- **A reference**  
  Jump directly to specific days when you need quick examples or reminders.

- **A practice space**  
  Fork the repo and add your own improvements, alternative solutions, or extra exercises.

Suggested approach:

1. Start from Day 1 and read the code carefully  
2. Re-implement the solution without copying  
3. Add at least one variation or improvement of your own  
4. Commit your changes (for example: `Day 01: added extra exercise`)  
5. Repeat daily and track your progress
