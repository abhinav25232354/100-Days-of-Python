# Function is used for grouping code
'''
There are two types of functions
1. Built-in function
2. User-defined function

# Like finding average of three numbers using function
def average(a, b, c):
    avg = a+b+c/3
    print(f"Average: {avg}")

def mean(a, b):
    pass # Pass keyword is used to process further leaving the function behind

average(10, 12, 15) # Function calling
average(5, 10, 20) # Function calling
